Outcome
Results,
‘Some Tumor Markers are outside the reference range and suggest <IN_PAN>.

“High”

Range: Low, Moderate, High
‘Comments

In absence of comorbidities that are wellknown source of False Positive (FP) in healthy patients by
<IN_PAN> some Tumor Markers levels, whole Tumor Markers levels suggest <IN_PAN>.

WE SUGGEST BLOOD CANCER. THE <DATE_TIME> ICD-10-CM DIAGNOSIS CODE IS <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> (MALIGNANT
NEOPLASM OF BLOOD)

This report has been generated from the data entered on <DATE_TIME> 10:55:02 UTC/GMT.

Disclaimer
This Multiple Biomarkers Disease Activity Algorithm (MBDAA) for Blood Cancer has been developed for the
exclusive use by healthcare professionals, and solely as a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS), not
<US_DRIVER_LICENSE> an unique element for diagnosis. The algorithm bears a Sensitivity = 82.3%, Specificity = 85.7%. Please
note, negativity of the Tumor Markers does not exclude at 100% the possibilty of a malignant epithelial
tumor.
