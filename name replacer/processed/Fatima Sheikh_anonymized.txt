This Multiple Biomarkers Disease Activity Algorithm (MBDAA) for Blood Cancer has been developed for the
exclusive use by healthcare professionals, and solely as a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS), not
a5 an unique element for diagnosis. The algorithm bears a Sensitivity = 82.3%, Specificity = 85.7%. Please
note, negativity of the Tumor Markers does not exclude at 100% the possibilty of a malignant epithelial
tumor.
